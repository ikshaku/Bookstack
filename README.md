# Bookstack

This react app was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This application allows a user to search for and save book data (title, author, description) to their library database from Google's Book API. It is a single page application that uses react and Google Books API to search for and save books to a database. The deployed project can be found on Heroku [here](https://radiant-cliffs-59967.herokuapp.com/).

The app allows a user to view the books they have stored in their MongoDB and read short descriptions about them as well as view the Google Books page for the book. They can switch to the "Search" page via the navbar and search for books by title and save any of the results to their library database.
